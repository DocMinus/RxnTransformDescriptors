## Running Tests
`pytest` is available for testing. Follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have installed the project dependencies, as described in the Installation section.
2. Install the testing dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```
    followed by 
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

    This command will discover and run all the test cases in the `tests/` directory.
